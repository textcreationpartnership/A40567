            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THis Day Landed ſeveral of my Acquaintance who left the County of <hi>Cork</hi> on the 24th of <hi>March,</hi> and give the following Particulars of the Late King <hi>James</hi>'s Landing and Reception there.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of <hi>March</hi> entered the Harbor of <hi>Kinſale</hi> 12 great Men of War with <hi>French</hi> Colours, 3 Fireſhips, 8 Merchantmen, and caſt Anchor before the Fort. Soon after the Earl of <hi>Clancartie,</hi> who commanded in that place, having Notice of His Late Majeſties being in the Fleet, gave Order to his Regiment to draw up ready to receive him, whil'ſt he went on Board the <hi>St. Michael</hi> to Congratulate His Happy Arrival to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In the Afternoon His Majeſty Landed, and went up to the Fort, being accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitz-James,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Powis,</hi> the Earl <hi>Melfort,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who lay tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Night in the Fort.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101844:2"/>
               <p>Thoſe who came with His Majeſty debarqued alſo at the ſame time, and went up to the Town, being to the Number of 150 Officers, which were all the Perſons that embarqued at <hi>Breſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There His Majeſty ſtay'd till the 15th, in which time the Arms, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Money were brought aſhore, and laid up in the Fort.</p>
               <p>The Liſt of the Arms delivered at <hi>Breſt</hi> amounted to 15000, together with 30000 Swords and Ammunition proportionable to the Service. There was alſo a 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money.</p>
               <p>During His Majeſties ſtay here, Lieutenant General <hi>Maccartie,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers came to Congratulate His Arrival, and on the 15th, he went to <hi>Cork,</hi> and lay at <hi>St. Dominicks,</hi> being received by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> after their rude and barbarous manner, by Bagpipes, Dancing, throwing their Mantles under his Horſes Feet, making a Garland of a Cabbage Stump, and ſuch like Expreſſions of Joy.</p>
               <p>During His ſtay at <hi>Cork,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brady,</hi> the Miniſter of the place, and Ten Men of <hi>Bandon</hi> petition'd Him for Pardon for that Town, which he granted, ſaying, <hi>You may now ſee you have a Gracious King.</hi> And when the Earl of <hi>Clancartie,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> urg'd the Deſtruction of that Neſt of Rebels: To the firſt he ſaid, <hi>He was a Young Man.</hi> And to the latter, <hi>That he was a Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that, came many of the diſtreſſed <hi>Engliſh,</hi> complaining of their barbarous Uſage, and how all they had was taken. Whereupon He iſſued out a Proclamation to quiet all, and that Reſtitution might be made to them; which the <hi>Rabble</hi> (or <hi>Rapperies,</hi> as they call them) little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, continued plundering publickly every day, not ſparing even their own Party: Inſomuch that of Ten Oxen which were ſent the King as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Two of them were by thoſe Villains taken away.</p>
               <p>Two Days after, notwithſtanding the King's Promiſe of Pardon to thoſe of <hi>Bandon,</hi> ſeveral were Indicted at the Aſſizes, inſomuch that 30 or 40 of them fled by this Opportunity, and came to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> being frightned at the bloody Proceeding againſt one Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who was Hang'd, Drawn and Quartered at the ſame Aſſizes.</p>
               <p>Several Petitions were alſo preferr'd for the Pardon of Sir <hi>Thomas South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> Capt. <hi>Mills,</hi> and many others, who being taken in their way to the <hi>North,</hi> were carried to <hi>Galloway,</hi> and there Try'd, and Condemn'd to dye: But the King rejected their Petition; however, reprieved them for three weeks, deferring it till His Arrival at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to which place <hi>He</hi> ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the 21ſt in the morning.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, is what's confirmed by all Perſons come over, who were Eye-Witneſſes of all that is here related; and who farther add, that moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Ships ſet Sail back again on the 17th for <hi>Breſt.</hi>
